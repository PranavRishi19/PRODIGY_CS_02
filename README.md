# Image Encryption

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt images using cryptographic techniques. Image encryption is essential for protecting sensitive visual data from unauthorized access. This example uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to securely encrypt and decrypt images.

## How It Works

The process involves reading the image data, encrypting it with a specified key, and then decrypting it back to its original form using the same key.

### Encryption

- **Input**: Image data as a binary string.
- **Output**: Encrypted image data.

### Decryption

- **Input**: Encrypted image data.
- **Output**: Decrypted image data (original image).

## Key Generation

A secure encryption key is generated using a cryptographic library. This key is crucial for both encryption and decryption processes.

### Example Key Generation

Using Python's `crypto` library:

```python
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

# Generate a random 32-byte key
key = get_random_bytes(32).hex()
print('Encryption Key:', key)
